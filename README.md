# SellF

Sell Fast is a World of Warcraft add-on that automates the process of listing materials on the Auction House. It automatically scans prices for the items in your bags, group them in appropriate stacks and calculates the price to be sold at. Upon opening the Auction House interface, the add-on fills in all the data needed for a sale, so all the player needs to do is press the “Sell” button (as fully programmatic selling of items is against the Terms of Service).
